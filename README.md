**C++ Introduction:** • C++ is a middle-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs. • C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory. • C++ can be found in today’s operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) and embedded systems. • C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms. • C++ runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS and the various versions of UNIX.

**Project Description:** • Casino Game or Number Guessing Game both are same. • In Casino we have to guess a number and if the number is matched with the Winning Number or Random Number than you will win the Lots of Money. • Here in the programming language we have a random number instead of Guess the number is real life.

**The C++ function, that guess the number, works based on the following criteria:** • First we will Take a Username and total amount of Money in Deposit. • Now player can play a Casino Game or Number Guessing Game . • Before playing a game player need to Bid for every time. • If computer generates the same number that was guessed then the player wins the game Otherwise he/she will lose the game. • I can play More until I have a single penny or maybe I can Win or Maybe not.
